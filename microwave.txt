A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. Heating more 
than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time. The program then writes out the
recommended heating time.
Sample Input and Output 1:
Enter the number of items
2
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
The recommended heating time is 7.50

Solution:
n = int(input("Enter the number of items\n"))
sht = float(input("Enter the single item heating time\n"))
if n==2:
    ht=sht+(0.5)*sht
    print("The recommended heating time is %.2f"%ht)
elif n==3:
    ht=sht*sht
    print("The recommended heating time is %.2f"%ht)
elif n>3:
    print("Number of items is more")
else:
    print("invalid input")
