Fourth inputs corresponds to the elements of the second list.

Output consists of the sorted elements

Sample Input & Output:

3

1

2

3

3

1

5

6


Sorted list is: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6]

Code:
n1 = int(input())
list1 = []
for i in range(n1):
    a=int(input())
    list1.append(a)
n2 = int(input())
list2 = []
for i in range(n2):
    b=int(input())
    list2.append(b)
total=list1+list2
total.sort()
print("Sorted list is:",total)
