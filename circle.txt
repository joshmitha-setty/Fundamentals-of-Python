In this problem you must write a program that determines if two circles intersect each other. The input to your program will be the <x, y> coordinates for the center of 
each circle, followed by the radius(r) of each circle. The output will state whether the circles overlap, do not overlap, or are tangential (i.e., tangential circles 
touch each other at just one common point).
Sample input:
10
3
10
6
1
Sample Output 1:
The circles are tangential

Solution:
import math
x1 = int(input())
y1 = int(input())
r1 = int(input())
x2 = int(input())
y2 = int(input())
r2 = int(input())
d = ((x2-x1)*(x2-x1)+(y2-y1)*(y2-y1))
dist=math.sqrt(d)
r=r1+r2
if(dist==r):
    print("The circles are tangential")
if(dist<r):
    print("The circles overlap")
if(dist>r):
    print("The circles do not overlap")
