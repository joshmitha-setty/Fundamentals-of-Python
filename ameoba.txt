The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national 
conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the 
amoeba’s size……???//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy
Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.
Sample input and Output 1:
Enter the number of Months :
7
The amoeba size is 8

Solution:
print("Enter the number of Months:\n")
n=int(input())
if n==1:
    print("The amoeba size is 0")
if n==2:
    print("The amoeba size is 1")
if n==3:
    print("The amoeba size is 1")
if n==4:
    print("The amoeba size is 2")
if n==5:
    print("The amoeba size is 3")
if n==6:
    print("The amoeba size is 5")
if n==7:
    print("The amoeba size is 8")
if n==8:
    print("The amoeba size is 13")
if n==9:
    print("The amoeba size is 21")
if n==10:
    print("The amoeba size is 34")
if n==11:
    print("The amoeba size is 55")
if n==12:
    print("The amoeba size is 89")
