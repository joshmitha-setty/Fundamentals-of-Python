 Sample Input1:
60.0
4
Sample Output1:
Enter the price of a dozen mangoes
Enter the price at which 1 mango is being sold
Loss : Rs.12.00

Solution:
n = float(input("Enter the price of a dozen mangoes\n"))
cost = float(input("Enter the price at which 1 mango is being sold\n "))
num = n//12
rate = cost*12
lp = n-rate
pp = rate-n
if num>cost:
    print("Loss : Rs.%.2f"%lp)
elif num<cost:
    print("Profit : Rs.%.2f"%pp)
else:
    print(" No profit nor loss ")
