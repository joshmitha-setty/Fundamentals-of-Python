Write a program that asks a user for their birth year encoded as two digits (like "62") and for the current year, also encoded as two digits (like "99"). 
The program is to correctly write out the userâ€™s age in years.
Sample Input and Output:
Enter Year of Birth
62
Enter Current year
99
Your age is 37

Solution:
by = int(input("Enter Year of Birth\n"))
cy = int(input("Enter Current Year\n"))
if by<cy:
    age = cy-by
    print("Your age is",age)
else:
    cy = cy+100
    age = cy-by
    print("Your age is",age)
