Write a program to find LCM of two numbers is discussed here. Two numbers are obtained as input and the prime factors of both the numbers are found. The product of the 
union of prime factors of both the numbers gives the LCM of the two numbers.
Sample output:
5
30
Sample Output:
LCM of 5 and 30 is 30

Solution:
num1 = int(input())  
num2 = int(input())   
def calculate_lcm(x, y):  
    if x > y:  
        greater = x  
    else:  
        greater = y  
    while(True):  
        if((greater % x == 0) and (greater % y == 0)):  
            lcm = greater  
            break  
        greater += 1  
    return lcm    
  
print(" LCM of", num1,"and", num2,"is", calculate_lcm(num1, num2))
