Ajay, Binoy and Chandru were very close friends at school. They were very good in Mathematics and they were the pet students of Emily Mam. Their gang was known as 
3-idiots. Ajay, Binoy and Chandru live in the same locality. A new student Dinesh joins their class and he wanted to be friends with them. He asked Binoy about his house
address. Binoy wanted to test Dinesh's mathematical skills. Binoy told Dinesh that his house is at the midpoint of the line joining Ajay's house and Chandru's house. 
Dinesh was puzzled. Can you help Dinesh out? Given the coordinates of the 2 end points of a line (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), write a python program to find the midpoint of line. 
Sample Input:
2
4
10
15
Sample Output:
Binoy's house is located at (6.0,9.5)

Solution:
x1 = int(input(" enter the value of x1: "))
y1 = int(input(" enter the value of y1: "))
x2 = int(input(" enter the value of x2 "))  
y2 = int(input(" enter the value of y2 "))
x3 = (x1+x2)/2 
y3 = (y1+y2)/2
print( " Binoy's house is located at ", (x3,y3))
